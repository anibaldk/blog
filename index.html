1. Optimising the search
- Optimising everything is impossible
- Finding out what's really relevant to the customers.
  - Search patterns and categorisation of terms
  - Am I tokenising the information propery?
- Detecting relevant results: supervised vs. unsupervised
  - supervised:
    - Manually run searches and evaluate the results
    - Asking for feedback from customers
  - Unsupervised:
    - Check search refinments from Analytics. When specific terms are refined, it indicates a problem
- Better ranking: Lexicographical vs I.A.

2. Tokenisation
- Stemmers (Portland and snowball): friends of foes?
- Dictionaries
